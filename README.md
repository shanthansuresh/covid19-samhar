## Problem Statement

In order to enforce social distancing, it is important to monitor  suspicious scenarios like crowd gathering or tracking etc. Usage of AI  (Convolution Neural Network) has surpassed traditional Computer Vision  techniques and can help automate this pattern recognition. The objective of this problem statement is to find different pattern on input sources like camera, satellite, social platforms which can help identify  suspicious activities to stop or track covid-19 spread.



## Description

The idea is to use crowd counting technique to identify the suspicious scenarios like crowd gathering, tracking etc during the social distancing and lockdown scenarios(during Pandemic diseases).
We considered to use CSRNet (which is based on VGGNet) which can understand highly congested scenes and perform accurate count estimation and high quaity density maps. 
We used pytorch framework to train and generate the model. We chose Nvidia Jetson Nano as a potential platform to run our model.

The idea is to detect the crowd gathering and indicate this information to the respective authorities to react in time and scatter the crowd to maintain social distancing and to stop spreading the disease.
